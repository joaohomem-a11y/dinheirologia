Look, I was going to bring you a detailed breakdown of which companies are promising "matching funds" — that scheme where they match employee donations — to accounts tied to Trump.

But you know what happened?

The original content is literally **a Yahoo cookies and privacy policy page**. That's right. The entire article that landed on my desk is a wall of "Accept all," "Reject all," "Your privacy is important to us."

The actual news? Buried behind a digital paywall disguised as concern for your data.

Poetic, isn't it?

## The Story Behind the Smoke Screen

Let's get to what matters, because the topic is real and it's popping up everywhere: multiple American companies are publicly announcing they'll match employee contributions directed to accounts and funds tied to Donald Trump. It's the classic corporate "matching fund" game — you donate a dollar, the company throws in another.

This isn't new in the American political cycle. Companies have always played this game. But what's turning heads right now is the **speed and volume** with which they're picking sides. It's practically a race to see who raises their hand first.

And why should you care — a Brazilian investor just trying to protect your wealth who couldn't care less about some gringo political soap opera?

**Because corporate money flowing in a political direction is a signal.** It always has been.

## Follow the Money, Not the Speech

There's a classic scene in *All the President's Men* — the Watergate movie — where the informant Deep Throat tells the journalist: **"Follow the money."**

When major corporations start publicly aligning with a candidate — especially one as polarizing as Trump — it tells you a few things:

**First:** These companies are betting this guy is going to win, or at the very least will have enough influence to make it worth being on his side. No CEO slaps their company's brand on a political bonfire out of idealism. It's cold calculation.

**Second:** The expected regulatory environment. If energy, tech, defense, and financial companies are rushing to embrace Trump, it's because they expect a government that'll loosen regulations, slash corporate taxes, and be more "business-friendly." This has direct implications for sectors you might be invested in through ETFs, BDRs, or U.S. stocks.

**Third:** Reputational risk has become irrelevant. Remember when companies scrambled to DISTANCE themselves from Trump after January 2021? Yeah. The pendulum swung back. And it swung back hard. This shows you how ESG and "corporate social responsibility" are, more often than not, pure theater. Wind changes, the script changes.

## What This Means for Your Portfolio

Make no mistake: this isn't about liking or disliking Trump. It's about **reading the board**.

If American corporate money is flowing in one direction, the sectors that benefit from that direction tend to perform. Traditional energy, defense, banks, construction — these are the usual suspects in a Trump 2.0 scenario.

Meanwhile, sectors that depend on progressive regulation — subsidized clean energy, for example — could take a hit.

Buffett always said: **"When someone tells you who they are, believe them."** These companies are telling you, loud and clear, where they think the wind is going to blow.

## About Yahoo and the Non-Story

Now, back to the absurdity: one of the world's biggest financial news platforms publishes a headline about companies donating to Trump, and what actually reaches the reader is a **cookie consent wall**. The real content, the journalism, stays locked up.

This is the information market in 2025. You are the product. Your data is worth more than the news. Yahoo — which used to be a powerhouse — is basically a data farmer wearing a financial portal costume today.

And here's the most important lesson: **don't rely on a single source.** Don't trust the algorithm to keep you informed. The guy who only reads headlines and accepts cookies without thinking is the same guy who buys a stock because his brother-in-law sent a tip in the WhatsApp group chat.

Damn it, do your homework. Dig deeper. Cross-reference your data. Stay skeptical.

Because at the end of the day, the question that remains is this: if America's biggest companies are putting their chips on the table, **where are yours?**
