The interview starts with Florian Bartunek admitting he got his start in the market doing daytrading over the phone!

> To win you have to know how to lose. - Claudio Copolla

> There are people who get rich doing daytrade and go broke doing long-term investing. There are people who go broke doing daytrade and get rich doing long-term investing. It's aptitude and personality. - Florian Bartunek

Man, it's almost moving to see what Florian did by uttering those words! In just a few sentences, with humility and wisdom, he showed what the circus is and what reality is.

It's not enough to just buy shares in good companies and hold. By the same token, it's also not enough to sit in front of a screen and think you're going to make money riding the intraday ups and downs.

At no point is there a debate defending one school and attacking the other. At no point are there the kind of cheap shots you hear from rival football club supporters. At no point do they position themselves as the owners of some absolute truth.

Because there stood two doers who each, in their own way, manage billions!

In financial markets your wallet shuts mouths!

Focus on your results and your development. The circus blinds and alienates.
