You know what's more revealing than the earnings report of a multinational pulling in 40 billion euros in revenue? The fact that almost nobody in Brazil pays attention to it.

Veolia Environnement — that French beast controlling water, waste, and energy across more than 40 countries — just dropped its Q4 2025 earnings presentation. And what do we get from Seeking Alpha? A slide deck. A transcript. The same old corporate meat and potatoes.

But hold up. Before you scroll past thinking this doesn't concern you, answer me one thing: **do you know that Veolia is one of the largest sanitation operators on the planet?** And that sanitation is, alongside energy, the most recession-proof sector in existence?

## The Elephant in the Room Nobody Sees

Veolia (ticker VEOEY on the US OTC, VEOEF for those who enjoy suffering in over-the-counter markets) is the kind of company Warren Buffett would call a "massive moat" — a competitive moat the size of the Atlantic Ocean.

Concession contracts running 20, 30 years. Heavy regulation that keeps new competitors from getting in. Recurring revenue like clockwork. And direct exposure to the ESG megatrend that, whether you like it or not, moves trillions in institutional allocation.

But the average Brazilian investor? Chasing meme stocks. Hunting the next MGLU3. Watching some YouTube guru talk about "500% trades in 3 days."

Meanwhile, Veolia is just sitting there, quiet as can be, doing the dirty work — literally — and generating cash.

## The "No Content" Problem

Now, I'll be honest with you, because that's the least I owe you: **the material released from this earnings call is, so far, basically the slide deck.** Detailed numbers, updated guidance, management commentary — all of that needs to be properly dissected once the full transcript drops.

And here's where a point Taleb would love comes in: **the market reacts to noise before processing the signal.**

Everyone wants the pre-chewed headline. "Veolia beats estimates" or "Veolia disappoints." Nobody wants to read 47 slides of a presentation written in corporate French translated into bureaucratic English. Nobody wants to understand EBITDA margin dynamics by segment between Water Technologies and Waste Solutions.

And that's exactly why there's hidden alpha in there.

## Why You Should Care

Look, if you have any investment thesis in utilities, infrastructure, or ESG — and if you don't, maybe you should rethink that — Veolia is a mandatory reference point. This isn't some random company. After the merger with Suez in 2022, it became a **consolidation machine** in the global environmental sector.

A few points worth watching when the detailed numbers come out:

- **Organic revenue growth**: the water sector has real pricing power, especially in regulated European markets.
- **EBITDA margin**: the Suez integration should already be delivering full synergies by now. If it's not, there's a problem.
- **Free cash flow generation**: an infrastructure company that doesn't generate robust free cash flow is a wax museum — pretty on the outside, dead on the inside.
- **2026 guidance**: any signals on capex and acquisitions will say a lot about management's ambition (or prudence).

## The Circus and Reality

While Brazil's financial market stays obsessed with the Selic rate, the dollar, and Brasília's political soap opera — and damn, I get it, it's impossible to ignore — there's an entire universe of global companies operating in essential sectors, generating cash like the Fed's money printer, and trading at multiples that would make any fundamental analyst drool.

Veolia is one of them.

I'm not telling you to go out and buy it. I'm telling you to **stop being intellectually lazy** and look beyond the Ibovespa.

The guy who only fishes in the same lake eventually finds out the lake dried up. And guess who's in charge of the water?
