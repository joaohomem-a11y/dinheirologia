There's an old game in financial markets that never goes out of style.

It works like this: you lower the bar. You convince the market that expectations are rock-bottom. Then the company delivers something mediocre. And everybody celebrates like they just won the championship.

It's the financial equivalent of flunking out, repeating the year, and then squeaking by with a 61 on the makeup exam — while your dad pops champagne.

That's exactly what happened with HSBC this week.

**The numbers, no filter**

The bank reported pre-tax profit of $29.91 billion for the full year. It beat analyst estimates of $28.86 billion. Revenue came in at $68.27 billion, also above forecast.

Then comes the detail the headline tries to bury: profit *fell* 7.4% compared to the previous year.

Seven point four percent. In dollar terms, that's a serious hole in shareholders' pockets.

But hey, "beat estimates." Break out the confetti, drop the beat, fire the flare gun.

Nassim Taleb already explained this phenomenon with brutal elegance: the market doesn't measure reality, it measures *relative surprise*. If the consensus expects the worst, anything above that becomes a positive story. It's the same psychological mechanism that makes a corrupt politician look like "the lesser evil."

You don't have to be good. You just have to be less bad than expected.

**What's really going on inside HSBC**

Let's take off the suit and look at the body underneath.

Revenue grew 4%. That's real. The wealth management arm and Hong Kong operations performed well. Fine, fair enough.

But the fourth quarter is where things get interesting — and suspicious. Quarterly profit jumped to $6.8 billion, $4.5 billion more than a year earlier. Sounds explosive, right?

Except that number was inflated by "favorable one-off items related to business disposals." In plain English: they sold assets, booked the accounting gain, and put it in the window like it was operating performance.

That has a name in the real world: *window dressing*. It's makeup. It's the Breaking Bad of the balance sheet — you turn a messy operation into a clean narrative for anyone who doesn't read the footnotes.

**The elephant in the bank lobby**

CEO Georges Elhedery talked about "decisive action and swift execution." Beautiful. But when CNBC asked about job cuts, the answer was straight out of a politician's playbook during election season.

He said the bank wants to cut payroll costs by *around 8%*, but that there are no "specific headcount reduction targets."

Translation: yes, they're cutting people, but he won't say that number out loud because the union is listening.

According to Bloomberg, HSBC also plans to use the bonus cycle to push out lower-performing employees — especially in investment banking and wealth management. Managing directors included.

Is that management, or is it corporate housecleaning dressed up as meritocracy?

Could be both. Probably is.

**Hang Seng: privatization or damage control?**

On January 26, HSBC completed the privatization of Hang Seng Bank, delisting its shares from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The bank sold the narrative that it was a "better use of capital than share buybacks."

Maybe. But privatizing an asset amid rising geopolitical uncertainty in the China-Hong Kong axis could also be a way to pull public exposure from something that might become a liability. Fewer eyes, fewer questions.

Morningstar thinks the synergies will materialize "gradually over the medium term." Corporate-speak for: "we have no idea when, but it sounds good."

**What does the smart investor do with this?**

Nothing impulsive. But nothing naive either.

HSBC announced a return on tangible equity (*RoTE*) target of 17% or more between 2026 and 2028. Today it sits at 13.3%. The gap between where they are and where they're promising to go demands flawless execution in a macro environment that's anything but predictable.

Interest rates, geopolitical tension in Asia, regulation in Hong Kong, and a CEO still in "prove himself" mode. That's a lot of variables to bet on a PowerPoint speech.

Warren Buffett has a line that fits perfectly here: *"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."*

HSBC still has its trunks on — for now. But the tide hasn't really gone out yet.

Are you analyzing your portfolio results with that same level of scrutiny — or are you satisfied with just "beating the estimate" of your own mediocrity?
