You click a link promising the "bullish thesis" on Erasca, Inc. (ERAS), a biotech small cap that's been catching speculators' attention, and what do you get?

A wall of cookies.

Not a joke. Not a metaphor. Literally.

Yahoo Finance — that platform your aunt uses to "follow the market" — published an article with a seductive title about Erasca's bull case and, when you click, what pops up is an entire page asking you to accept 246 partners tracking every pixel of your digital life.

**The actual content? Zero. Nothing. Zilch.**

It's the financial equivalent of a movie trailer that shows all the good scenes, and when you get to the theater it's a two-hour piece of crap that delivers absolutely nothing.

## The Financial Information Circus

This should bother a lot more people than it does.

We live in an era where the *packaging* of financial information is worth more than the information itself. Yahoo knows that headlines like "Bull Case Theory" generate clicks. Generate traffic. Generate data. And data feeds the advertising machine.

You're the product. Not the reader.

Nassim Taleb would call it the perfect example of **inverted skin in the game**: whoever produces the "content" bears zero risk if you make a dumb decision based on something you never even properly read. They win on the click. You're stuck with the risk.

It's like that scene from The Matrix — you take the blue pill thinking you'll discover the truth, and you wake up in the same damn bed, except now with 246 trackers monitoring whether you prefer Treasuries or Small Caps so they can shove day-trading course ads down your throat.

## So What About Erasca, Anyway?

Since Yahoo didn't do its job, let me give you the bare minimum context you deserved when you clicked that link.

**Erasca, Inc. (NASDAQ: ERAS)** is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on therapies for cancer patients. The main pipeline revolves around RAS/MAPK pathway inhibitors — a cell signaling pathway that, when dysregulated, is behind multiple solid tumors.

The bullish thesis that was *supposedly* going to be presented probably revolves around:

- **Promising pipeline** with naftifine (ERS-26) and other candidates targeting pathways that big pharma has its eyes on
- **Potential partnerships** with major labs that love scooping up biotech small caps when clinical data comes in positive
- **Depressed valuation** — like most of the small cap biotech sector that got beaten to a pulp by high interest rates
- **M&A potential** — if clinical trial results come in strong, someone big might want to buy the whole company

But — and this is where the "to the moon" crowd needs to listen up — clinical-stage biotech is a **casino in a lab coat**. This is not an investment for anyone who can't stomach seeing -50% on a bad clinical data day.

Benjamin Graham would be rolling in his grave if he saw people calling speculation in pre-revenue biotech an "investment." There's a brutal difference between informed speculation (which is legitimate) and a "bull case" narrative sold as if it were a sure thing.

## The Real Problem

The problem isn't Erasca. It might even be a decent company with real science behind it.

The problem is the **informational garbage ecosystem** that's been built around financial markets. Headlines that promise analysis and deliver cookies. "Gurus" who talk about the bullish thesis without showing the bearish one. Platforms that monetize your attention while pretending to inform you.

For crying out loud, if you're going to talk about the bull case, you have a **moral obligation** to talk about the risk too. To mention that the company burns cash. That the FDA can deny approval. That the small cap biotech sector is a graveyard of broken promises.

But that doesn't generate clicks, does it?

So here's the question nobody at Yahoo is going to ask you: **if the platform that "informs" you makes money off your data and not off the quality of its information, why the hell would you trust it to make decisions with your money?**

Think about that before your next click.
