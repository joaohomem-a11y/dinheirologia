There's an old saying that seasoned traders know well: *what isn't said is worth more than what is.*

Trump just delivered the longest State of the Union address in American history. The man talked about inflation, tariffs, stock market records, Venezuela, the military, the border — the whole show. It went on forever.

And China? Practically nothing.

A single nod. A passing reference to "Russian and Chinese military technology" protecting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. That's it. The 1.4 billion-person giant, the world's second-largest economy, America's chief geopolitical rival, the godfather of the most serious technological adversary the U.S. has ever faced — mentioned as a background extra in a story about Venezuela.

If you found that strange, you're paying attention.

## The Strategic Silence of Someone Who Wants to Close a Deal

Let's cut to the chase: Trump is planning to visit Beijing between March 31 and April 2. It would be the first visit by an American president to China since 2017. And the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs still hasn't officially confirmed the dates.

Think hard about what that means.

Gabriel Wildau of Teneo put it plainly: *"Trump doesn't want to antagonize China in a midterm election year."* The midterms are coming in November, and stability in relations with Beijing has become priority number one.

Translation from policy-speak into plain English: Trump is currently on his best behavior with China, trying to lock in the visit, and trash-talking his partner during the most-watched speech of the year would kill the deal before it closes.

It's basic. It's human. It's Trump being Trump — a businessman first and foremost.

But there's a detail that stings. George Chen of The Asia Group pointed out that the Chinese side still hasn't confirmed the visit dates. *"This makes Trump look more desperate to visit China than Xi Jinping wants to receive him."*

And that's where Nassim Taleb whispers in your ear: whoever needs the deal more has less power at the table.

## The Tariff Circus Isn't Over Yet

To understand why this silence matters to you as an investor, you need the full context.

Last spring, the U.S. and China beat each other bloody with tariffs north of 100%. It was a real trade war. In October they reached a truce — tariffs dropped below 50% for the next year.

But last week, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the tariffs Trump had imposed. He immediately started hunting for another legal basis to reinstate them. The uncertainty was back before the weekend was over.

Meanwhile, China was quietly tightening its grip on rare earth exports — the critical minerals that go into absolutely everything: EV batteries, semiconductors, military equipment. China dominates that supply chain in a way that makes any oil dependency look amateur.

Wildau summed it up with surgical precision: *"The speech showed that Trump believes glorifying military triumphs over weak states like Venezuela makes better electoral politics than picking a fight with China over rare earths."*

Translation: picking a fight with Venezuela gets easy applause. Picking a fight with China can break the entire American tech supply chain. Those are completely different bets.

## The Irony the Democrats Loved to Serve

While Trump was avoiding any mention of China on the main stage, the Democratic rebuttal went straight for the jugular.

Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger came in hot: *"While the president talks about his supposed successes, he continues surrendering economic power and technological strength to Russia, bowing to China, bowing to a Russian dictator."*

Nice political hit. But hollow on real substance — which is the trademark of an opposition doing opposition theater for its own sake.

The real point is something else entirely. Yue Su, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, put something worth noting on the table: Biden, for all his flaws, kept a consistent and predictable line on China. You could model it. You could price the risk.

With Trump, you're operating in the dark. Markets love predictability and hate ambiguity. And this strategic silence is, by definition, ambiguity wrapped in a diplomatic smile.

## What This Means for You

If Trump lands in Beijing and closes a major trade deal, markets will go absolutely haywire to the upside. Tech, commodities, American exports — everything could rip on a "trade peace" narrative.

If the visit stalls, if Xi plays hardball, if tariffs start climbing again — brace yourself.

Trump's silence on China during the longest speech in American presidential history is not an oversight. It's a calculation.

The question you should be asking isn't "why didn't he mention it?" — it's **"what is he negotiating in silence, and am I positioned on the right side of that trade?"**

Anyone with skin in the game already knows that when Trump goes quiet about
