There's a Charlie Munger quote I love: *"The desire to get rich fast is probably the most common cause of getting poor slowly."*

Well then. The BNY Mellon Small Cap Value Fund (RUDAX) just published its fourth quarter 2025 commentary and, damn, it's the same old story: it lost to the benchmark. The Russell 2000 Value Index — which is basically the plain vanilla of value small caps — beat the fund once again. And the asset manager, with its 240 years of history and nearly $2 trillion under management, had to sit down and explain why their suit-wearing analysts blew it.

## What went wrong (spoiler: healthcare and financials)

The main culprit? **Bad stock picking in healthcare and financials.** Two sectors that are landmines for anyone who doesn't know where they're stepping.

The overweight position in **Evolent Health (Class A)** was a self-inflicted wound. The company cratered after a third-quarter earnings call that disappointed everyone. Remember that scene in Joker where he says *"You get what you fucking deserve"*? Yeah. Anyone who bought Evolent betting on growth in value-based healthcare management got exactly what the market thought they deserved: a beatdown.

**Walker & Dunlop**, in the financials sector, also dragged things down. The dynamic duo of losses.

Now, it wasn't all doom and gloom. **Lumentum Holdings**, an optics and photonics company that wasn't even in the benchmark index, rode a beautiful wave. The expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. — riding the reshoring wave and the "bring production back home" narrative — gave the stock a massive tailwind. When the wind's at your back, even a leaky boat can sail. But one swallow doesn't make a summer.

## The macro picture: neither apocalypse nor paradise

This is where BNY's commentary gets interesting — and where most retail investors should be paying attention.

The macroeconomic backdrop in the U.S., according to the report, shows a cautious balance: **inflation moderating, wage growth cooling, but nothing pointing to recession.** It's that Goldilocks scenario Wall Street loves — not too hot, not too cold.

Equity markets performed positively in both developed and emerging markets. Investor confidence held steady, supported by visibility into corporate earnings and resilient economic growth, despite geopolitical uncertainty that keeps lurking around every corner.

Translated from Econ-speak: *"Everything's more or less okay, but nobody's sure about anything."*

## The big bet for 2026: rate cuts and small caps

This is where the rubber meets the road — and where I get skeptical.

BNY's central thesis for 2026 is that **early rate cuts by the Fed will benefit small caps**, which historically are more sensitive to lower borrowing costs. Makes sense in theory. Small caps are more credit-dependent, carry more variable-rate debt, and when money gets cheap, they can breathe.

Beyond rate cuts, the report points to three cyclical catalysts: **AI investment, reshoring (bringing production back to the U.S.), and increased M&A activity.** And discounted valuations relative to large caps round out the argument.

Looks real pretty on the PowerPoint. But I remember 2024, when everybody was also "anticipating" rate cuts that took forever to actually show up. The market is an expert at pricing in what it wants to believe — and then getting punched in the face when reality comes knocking.

And there's more: the report also highlights **international stocks, especially value plays in developed markets**, as attractive opportunities for 2026. Lower valuations, higher dividend yields, accommodative policies in Europe and Asia. Sure. But who's managing the currency risk in that game?

## What this means for you

If you invest in American small cap funds — or are thinking about it — this report is an important reminder: **even asset managers with 240 years of history and trillions under management lose to the passive index.** That should make anyone think twice before paying a fat management fee thinking they're buying "superior expertise."

Nassim Taleb would ask: where's the skin in the game for these managers? Their paychecks hit every month regardless of whether the fund beats the benchmark or not.

The real question you should be asking yourself isn't "will small caps go up in 2026?" — it's: **if even BNY Mellon can't consistently beat the Russell 2000 Value with active stock picking, why the hell do you think the Instagram guru is going to pull it off?**

Think about that before you hit the buy button.
