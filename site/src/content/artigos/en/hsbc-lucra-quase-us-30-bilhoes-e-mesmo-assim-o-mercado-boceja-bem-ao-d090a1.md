There's a classic scene in *The Wolf of Wall Street* where Matthew McConaughey's character explains to rookie Jordan Belfort that nobody — *nobody* — knows if a stock is going up or down. What matters is the commission. It's a different game entirely.

Well. HSBC just dropped its annual results and the circus rolls on.

## The Numbers the Suit-and-Tie Crowd Loves to Quote

Europe's biggest bank reported pre-tax profit of **$29.91 billion** in 2025. Beat the analyst estimate of $28.86 billion. Revenue jumped 4% year over year, hitting **$68.27 billion** — also above the consensus of $67.36 billion.

Looks pretty, right?

Except that profit **fell 7.4%** compared to the year before. Nobody puts *that* in the headline in big bold letters.

The fourth quarter got a turbo boost from "favorable non-recurring items" tied to business divestitures. Translation from corporate-speak: they sold off pieces of the house and counted it as salary. Operating expenses climbed 8%, to $9.3 billion — restructuring, tech investment, and bigger bonuses for top performers. For those who *didn't* perform... well, that's a different conversation.

## The Hang Seng Bank Play

The news that actually matters here isn't the dolled-up quarterly profit. It's the fact that HSBC completed the **privatization of Hang Seng Bank** on January 26, delisting its shares from the Hong Kong stock exchange.

CEO Georges Elhedery — who talks pretty like every trained executive — said the full acquisition is an "exciting opportunity to grow both brands." That they'll preserve the Hang Seng brand while investing in strengthening its capabilities.

Translation: we bought the neighbor's shop and we're keeping the sign out front, but we're the owners now.

Kathy Chan, analyst at Morningstar, threw the cold water I love: revenue and cost synergies "should come gradually over the medium term." In other words, don't expect magic tomorrow.

## Chopping Heads: The Part Nobody Wants to Talk About

Here's where things get interesting — and brutal, as financial markets always are.

Elhedery told CNBC that HSBC is targeting an **8% reduction in payroll costs**, but that "there are no specific headcount reduction targets." At the same time, he admitted to a net reduction of **15% of managing director roles** through "elimination of duplications."

Come on, that *is* headcount cutting. Just dressed up in perfumed corporate language.

Bloomberg reported that the bank will hand out **minimal or zero bonuses** to some bankers as part of a more aggressive new compensation model inspired by Wall Street competitors. The idea is to use the bonus round to push underperformers out the door — including executive directors — in areas like investment banking and wealth management.

Nassim Taleb would love this part. At least here there's a bit of skin in the game: if you don't deliver, you're out. The problem is when these cuts are purely political and the incompetent big shots stay protected while the guy grinding it out in operations takes the knife.

## And the Market? Shrugged.

HSBC shares in Hong Kong **fell 0.46%** on the day. Profit above estimates, revenue above estimates, and the market... yawned.

That's because the market isn't stupid. It looks forward. And what it sees is a megabank trying to hit a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 17% by 2028, starting from 13.3% in 2025. It's ambitious. It's possible. But it depends on execution, not PowerPoint decks.

HSBC is a machine. But machines rust when management turns into bureaucracy. And European megabanks have a glorious track record of promising restructuring and delivering... more of the same.

So, investor: would you buy a bank that pulls in $30 billion in profit but is slashing headcount, swallowing a subsidiary, and promising efficiency "over the medium term"? Or would you rather sit this one out in the nosebleeds, watching the circus and waiting for the real price of admission to drop?

Because if there's one thing I've learned in this market, it's that when the CEO talks about "decisive and swift execution," the bill always comes due — we just don't know yet who's picking up the tab.
