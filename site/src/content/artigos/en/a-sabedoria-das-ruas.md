From a very young age I was obsessed with martial arts. On the walls of my bedroom hung posters of Bruce Lee and Van Damme.

My parents couldn't afford to pay for a gym, so I'd replicate the training moves I saw in the movies. My late grandmother, Vovó Dila, seeing all my dedication, used part of her pension to fund my training.

Time passed, I got really good at Taekwondo, and adolescence started getting rough. While everyone expected me to win any fight — given my Olympic-level Taekwondo — I kept getting wrecked.

I was furious knowing that in theory nobody should be able to beat me, but out in the streets, outside the safety of the gym, I couldn't beat anyone.

One day, while taking flying kicks from every direction, I noticed I wasn't afraid anymore. A punch to the face or a kick in the stomach didn't matter anymore. And then I started to smile...

...And to hit back. Hard.

The books available for our study are very good, the resources for practicing in a safe environment keep getting better, but none of that will give you the wisdom of the streets.

> The dog brags to the wolf about all the comforts and luxuries he enjoys, almost convincing the wolf. Until the wolf notices the dog's chafed neck, asks about the collar, and is horrified: "Tied up? Goodbye, friend! I won't follow you! I don't envy your meals." - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

There's no way to be good at investing or trading without going through the long process of proving yourself in the streets.

> If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing. - Taleb

So what are you waiting for to get started?
