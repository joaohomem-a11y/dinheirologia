You know that scene in the movie where the guy is smiling on stage and the floor opens up beneath him?

Yeah. Workday (WDAY) just lived that out in real life.

The HR and finance software company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday and, on paper, it actually beat expectations: adjusted earnings of $2.47 per share versus the $2.32 expected, revenue of $2.53 billion versus the $2.52 billion projected.

Decent numbers, right?

**Wrong.**

The market didn't give a damn about past numbers and looked ahead — and it didn't like what it saw one bit. Shares tanked 10% in after-hours trading. And when you stack that on top of the **39% decline in 2025**, we're talking about the worst bloodbath since the company went public in 2012.

## The guidance that soured the party

Workday projected first fiscal quarter subscription revenue of $2.335 billion and an adjusted operating margin of 30.5%. Analysts were expecting $2.35 billion and a 30.9% margin.

"Come on, the difference is tiny."

Buddy, in the world of growth stocks — companies that trade at stratospheric multiples precisely on the promise of growth — **every decimal matters**. It's like that scene from Breaking Bad: Heisenberg doesn't accept 99.1% purity. The market doesn't either.

For fiscal year 2027, the company projects subscription revenue between $9.93 billion and $9.95 billion, implying 12% to 13% growth. Looks fine in isolation, but for a stock that was once priced as a 20%+ growth machine, that's a deceleration that stings.

## The elephant in the room: the AI that devours its own children

This is where the story gets interesting — and a little dark.

The entire market is in panic over a simple, brutal narrative: **what if AI models make big enterprise software obsolete?** If an AI agent can process payroll, manage benefits, and plan resources without that clunky ERP system, why pay the premium subscription?

Co-founder Aneel Bhusri — who, by the way, **just reassumed the CEO role** after Carl Eschenbach bailed out after only three years — tried to calm the waters on the earnings call:

*"You've heard the narrative that HR and ERP will be replaced or relegated to the back seat by AI. I personally don't see that happening."*

Well, Aneel, the market disagreed with the force of a money truck driving away from the stock.

And here's the irony: Workday itself has been investing heavily in AI. It launched AI agents for shift management, acquired the startup Pipedream to connect AI agents to external services, and says its annualized AI product revenue already exceeds $400 million.

The problem? **$400 million in AI at a company pulling in nearly $10 billion in revenue is a garnish, not the main course.** And the market wants to see the main course.

## The CEO swap: smoke signal or full-blown fire?

You can't ignore the timing. Eschenbach left on February 9th. The co-founder came back. CFO Zane Rowe made a point of saying that "Aneel's focus is on driving growth rather than simply hitting operating margin targets."

Translating from corporate-speak to human language: **we're going to spend more and grow, even if margins take a hit.**

When a co-founder comes back home, it's usually for one of two reasons: either the opportunity is too massive to pass up (see Howard Schultz at Starbucks), or the house is on fire and nobody else wants to hold the firework.

Rob Enslin, the chief commercial officer, admitted that deals with large new clients — especially in federal government and healthcare — are taking longer to close. That, combined with macroeconomic uncertainty and the existential fear of AI, makes for one unappetizing cocktail.

## What does this actually mean?

Workday isn't broken. Growing 14.5% year over year with $2.5 billion in quarterly revenue isn't something just anyone can pull off. But the market doesn't pay for what you **are** — it pays for what it **believes you'll become**.

And now, with the ghost of AI eroding confidence, a rookie-who's-actually-a-veteran CEO, and guidance that excites absolutely no one, the remaining question is the one Nassim Taleb would ask:

**Who has skin in the game here?** Bhusri, who co-founded the company and went back to the trenches? Or the suit-wearing analysts who spent two years screaming "AI is a tailwind!" and are now flipping the script at the first weak guidance?

Keep your eyes peeled. When the tide goes out, you find out who's been swimming naked.
