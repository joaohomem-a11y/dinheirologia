"*Reality doesn't give a damn about your PowerPoint.*"

That sentence should be framed on the wall of every CEO who, over the past five years, walked onto a stage with lasers and fog machines to announce they were going to "lead the electric revolution." Well then: Stellantis — that massive conglomerate controlling Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler, Peugeot, and a whole bunch of other brands you've either driven or dreamed of driving — just posted the **first annual loss in its history**.

This wasn't a minor stumble on the curb. It was a crater of **€22.3 billion**. Converted: roughly **$26.3 billion**. To put that in perspective, you could buy the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Mets, and still have enough left over to pick up an NBA franchise.

## The write-down that's really a confession

Inside that massive loss, **€25.4 billion are write-downs** — in plain English, the company looked at everything it invested in electric vehicles and said: "This stuff isn't worth what we thought it was."

It's like that guy who bought Bitcoin at $69,000 in 2021 and now has to face his account statement. Except here we're talking about factories, technology platforms, entire assembly lines built on a single premise: *the whole world is going to want an electric car, and they're going to want it now*.

CEO Antonio Filosa — who inherited this ticking time bomb — was surgical in his statement: "Our 2025 results reflect **the cost of overestimating the pace of the energy transition**."

Translation from corporate-speak: "We bought into the narrative, and the narrative was bullshit."

## It's not just Stellantis — the whole sector is retreating

This is where the story gets really interesting for investors.

Stellantis isn't alone in this billion-dollar mea culpa. **GM, Ford, and Honda** — all of them — announced massive write-downs in recent months, acknowledging they threw money into a pit called "EVs at any cost."

This is corporate herd mentality in its purest form. Remember *The Big Short*? When everyone in the American housing market swore prices could only go up? Same dynamic here. CEOs watched Tesla riding a wave, governments handing out subsidies like candy on Halloween, and thought: "If we don't jump in now, we'll be left behind."

The problem? **The consumer never got the script.**

The average consumer — the one paying bills, supporting a family, and needing a car that works without the drama — looked at the EV price tag, looked at the real range (not the one in the brochure), looked at the charging infrastructure, and said: "No thanks. Give me the hybrid. Or better yet, give me the good old combustion engine."

## The numbers that matter for investors

- **Adjusted operating loss of €842 million** in 2025 versus a profit of €8.65 billion in 2024. That's epic value destruction.
- **Dividends suspended in 2026.** If you were a shareholder counting on that yield, well, tough luck.
- **Shares dropped more than 31% on the year.** And fell another 0.8% on announcement day — the market had already priced in part of the disaster.
- The company **issued €5 billion in hybrid bonds** to shore up its cash position. Translation: it had to take on debt to survive its own bet.

The "less bad" side? In the second half of 2025, revenues rose 10% and shipments in North America improved. The company promises positive industrial free cash flow by 2027 and reiterated mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance for 2026.

In other words: there's a recovery plan. But plans look great on paper — execution is a whole different story.

## The lesson nobody wants to hear

Nassim Taleb would say this is the classic cost of fragility: systems that look robust in calm waters and blow up at the first headwind. Stellantis bet on a linear narrative — "inevitable and accelerated energy transition" — and discovered that **the future isn't linear, it's chaotic**.

The electric car market isn't dead. But the fantasy that it would be instant mass adoption? That one's in the coffin.

And you, investor: next time a CEO with a toothpaste-commercial smile promises you an "inevitable revolution," remember these $26 billion that went up in smoke.

**The one who footed the bill wasn't the CEO. It was the shareholders.**

It always is.
