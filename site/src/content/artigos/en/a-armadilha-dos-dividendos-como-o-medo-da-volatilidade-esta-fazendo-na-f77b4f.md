  the worst decision you make in 2026

There's a scene in *The Godfather* where Vito Corleone says: "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." Well, that's exactly what the market does to scared investors. Volatility comes knocking, your stomach turns, and then comes that "offer you can't refuse": fat dividends, high-yield bonds, that predictable cash flow that lets you sleep at night.

Except that offer can cost you a fortune.

## The Warning Nobody Wants to Hear

Nick Ryder, CIO of Kathmere Capital Management — a firm managing $3.5 billion — cut straight to the chase on CNBC's *ETF Edge* this week:

> "We see far too often people taking an income-focused approach, and it leaves a lot of money on the table."

In plain English: while you're hugging your dividend security blanket thinking you're safe, the market's ripping higher and you're standing on the platform watching the train pull away.

Ryder advocates what he calls a **total return approach** — which basically means stop fixating on the drip that hits your account every month and focus on growing your overall wealth. Stocks, bonds, the whole enchilada, with discipline and a long-term horizon.

## The Yield Trap That Swallows Good People Whole

Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, backed up the warning in the same interview: *"Being smart about yield means balancing attractive income with long-term capital appreciation... not simply chasing the highest yield possible. We think that is a yield trap."*

And that's where things get ugly, my friend.

When the retail investor — the regular person, you and me — sees the market get shaky, the lizard brain screams: **"Run to safety!"** And what looks safe? Dividend-paying stocks, fixed-income funds, that ETF with an 8% yield that seems too good to be true.

Guess what: it usually is too good to be true.

Ryder breaks down the mechanics of silent destruction: in the fixed-income world, yield-chasing leads investors to extend interest rate risk, increase portfolio duration, and migrate from investment-grade bonds to high-yield bonds — which, in his words, *"have dramatically different risk and return expectations."*

It's like trading in an armored Toyota Camry for a Ferrari with no brakes. Looks like an upgrade, but the first sharp turn shows you the difference.

## The Paradox of Fear

Here's what deeply pisses me off about the financial market circus: the dominant narrative is always binary. Either you're aggressive and buying leveraged Nasdaq, or you're conservative and living off dividends. There's no middle ground in your Instagram feed.

Ryder proposes something absurdly sensible and, precisely because of that, unpopular: **start with your goals and your real risk tolerance. Then — and only then — add the income layer.**

Sound obvious? It is. But almost nobody does it.

What most people do is the opposite: they see a volatile market, panic, and build their entire portfolio around "how much do I get per month." The consequence? Unintentional bets. The portfolio that was supposed to be defensive turns into a ticking time bomb concentrated in specific sectors, carrying credit risk the investor doesn't even know they're holding.

## The Economy Isn't Sending an SOS

And then there's the macro context, which a lot of people ignore out of pure negativity bias.

*"On the whole, the economy has been quite resilient,"* Ryder said. *"Corporate profitability has been very resilient."*

Damn, when the CIO of a multi-billion-dollar firm tells you the landscape is healthy, and you still run and hide behind dividends like it's the end of the world, the problem isn't the market. The problem is your emotions running your portfolio.

Nassim Taleb would say you're confusing volatility with risk. They're different things. Volatility is the price swinging. Risk is losing purchasing power over decades because you clung to a 4% yield while inflation was eating 3.5%.

## The Question That Lingers

Are you investing based on your long-term goals — or are you just buying short-term emotional comfort and calling it a strategy?

Because if it's the second one, that money you left "on the table" could be exactly the difference between retiring with dignity and retiring dependent on handouts.

Think about that before you hit the button.
