Fifty-three years.

That's how long it took the United States to send people toward the Moon again. Over half a century. In that time, humanity invented the iPhone, created Bitcoin, launched an electric car into space as a publicity stunt — and NASA was basically stuck in low orbit, spinning around the Earth like a hamster on a wheel.

Now, with the **Artemis II** mission, America's space agency promises to turn that page. And the headline is beautiful, I won't lie: Victor Glover will be the first Black astronaut and Christina Koch the first woman to travel to the Moon. Historic. Powerful. Genuinely inspiring.

But let's separate the marketing from reality, like we always do here.

## What the mission actually is (and what it isn't)

First, let's manage expectations: **nobody's setting foot on the Moon on this mission**. It's a *flyby* — the spacecraft takes a lap around the satellite and heads back home. Think of that guy who drives to the Porsche dealership, snaps a selfie in front of the car, and takes the bus home. Looks cool, but it's not the same thing.

Artemis II carries four astronauts — Glover, Koch, commander Reid Wiseman, and Canadian Jeremy Hansen — on a trip around the Moon aboard the Orion capsule, mounted on the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. The mission follows the success of Artemis I, which made the same trip unmanned in 2022.

The official goal? Test life support systems, collect data on astronaut health in deep space, and validate technologies for the next step — which would eventually be the Artemis III lunar landing and, in the distant future, Mars.

## The billion-dollar elephant in the control room

This is where the conversation gets interesting — and where mainstream media prefers not to push too hard.

Space historian Amy Shira Teitel herself, who's been studying this stuff for over two decades, didn't hold back: the SLS rocket is **"widely considered a massive boondoggle."** And she's right.

The SLS has already cost over **$23 billion in development**. Each launch runs about **$4 billion**. For comparison, Elon Musk's SpaceX launches a Falcon Heavy for around $150 million. Yes, they're different rockets with different capabilities, but that cost gap is enough to make any financial analyst choke on their coffee.

The mission, originally scheduled for February 2026, has already been pushed to March — at the earliest. Delays at NASA are as predictable as the Fed hiking rates when inflation runs hot. It's just part of the game.

And there's more: the Artemis program involves "goodwill" agreements with Saudi Arabia, Germany, and other countries. Shared resources, space diplomacy. Looks great on paper. In practice, it's heavy-duty geopolitics dressed up as science — every nation wanting its slice of the lunar pie, where there's potential to mine resources like helium-3 and rare minerals.

## The part that actually matters

All that said, it would be a real jerk move on my part not to acknowledge what this mission means in human terms.

Victor Glover is a decorated U.S. Navy captain. Christina Koch started as a NASA engineer and conducted scientific research before becoming an astronaut in 2013. These are professionals **with skin in the game** — people who bet their entire careers, trained for decades, risked their lives. They're not marketing props.

As MIT professor Danielle Wood put it: *"There are still many glass ceilings that need to be broken by Black women, Black men, and women in general — that's still real."*

And it is.

But here's the provocative question nobody wants to ask: **is the crew's diversity being used as a narrative shield to deflect attention from the budget elephant?** Because it's a hell of a lot easier to sell an inspiring headline than to explain to the American taxpayer why each seat on that rocket cost over **one billion dollars**.

The Moon is still up there. The question is whether the path NASA chose to get there makes economic sense — or whether we're watching the biggest public works project in the universe, literally.

Would you foot that bill?
