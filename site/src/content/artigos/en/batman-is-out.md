> Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me. They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper. You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. - The Joker

I was never the good guy, and I never even tried at any point in my life to look like the good guy.

My interest in creating a traders group was entirely selfish. When reaching out to a broker and bluffing about having a traders group, I saw I could land a discount on commissions that was fundamental to my survival in the market at that moment. Hence the Facebook post announcing cheap brokerage fees, and then things just happened.

An individual need, a bluff, and an announcement. After that, my survival depended solely on my own performance.

But with great power comes great responsibility. By becoming the leader of a group, I also became everyone's therapist.

The revolution bore good fruit for everyone. Even for those who had never heard of me or of SST.

After many wins, I started to realize that no matter how hard I fought for Gotham in the darkness, the people wanted a well-lit circus.

We are not measured by our own ruler. We are measured by everyone else's.

> People are only as good as the world allows them to be. When the chips are down, these civilized people will eat each other. - The Joker

For a long time now I've been pulling further and further away from the market circus. I do my thing and try to help in the best way I can those who come to me. All through SST, which remains my only link to Gotham.

Meanwhile, it hurts deeply to see the villains being placed on pedestals as Gods of Olympus, to see articles throwing an entire class of professionals in the same bucket as the crooks.

Just venting. After all, if I serve as a therapist for so many, why not take turns every once in a while?
