While half the market is still debating whether artificial intelligence is a bubble or a revolution, Axon Enterprise just shut everyone up with cold, hard numbers.

The stock shot up nearly 18% in a single day. Not on hype. Not on some PowerPoint slide promise. On actual results, real money hitting the books.

## The numbers that made the market jump out of its seat

The maker of Tasers, body cameras, and drones reported adjusted earnings of $2.15 per share on revenue of $797 million in the fourth quarter. Wall Street was expecting $1.60 per share and $755 million in revenue.

Read that again? **They beat the earnings estimate by 34%.** That's not a fine-tuning. That's a beatdown.

And the cherry on top: guidance for 2026 came in with projected growth between 27% and 30%, while analysts — always conveniently conservative — were expecting 25.8%.

Revenue grew 39% year over year. Forty percent. For a company that sells Tasers to cops.

## But wait — where's the net income?

Here's the detail most outlets will sweep under the rug.

Net income cratered from $135 million ($1.67 per share) to a measly $3 million ($0.03 per share). That's right. From a buck sixty-seven to three cents.

The company explained the drop was due to "operating losses and strategic investment activities." Translation from corporate-speak to plain English: they're burning serious cash to grow. They're going all-in at the table.

And this is where you need to think like a grown-up.

When a company sacrifices short-term profit to invest aggressively in AI — and the revenue and booking numbers confirm the bet is paying off — that's a signal. It could be good, it could be dangerous. It depends on execution.

CEO Rick Smith, who founded the company in 1993, said AI has brought "a moment unlike anything" he's seen in over 30 years. Coming from a guy with real *skin in the game*, who built the company from scratch, that carries weight. This isn't some hired-gun CEO parroting buzzwords to keep the board happy.

## What AI actually does for Axon

This isn't vague talk. AI capabilities represented roughly 10% of total bookings last year — somewhere around $750 million. We're talking about:

- **Automatic license plate recognition** integrated into the ecosystem
- **AI-activated voice assistant** embedded in body cameras (the "Axon Assistant," which already has over 500 clients)
- Software tools growing at **40% in the quarter**, hitting $343 million

CFO Brittany Bagley was blunt: she expects the software business to outpace hardware growth soon. And it makes total sense. Hardware means tight margins, heavy logistics, price competition. Software with built-in AI means fat margins, recurring revenue, and customer lock-in.

It's the same old model Microsoft and Adobe already proved: sell the Swiss Army knife, but make your money on the sharpening stone subscription.

## The 2028 target — ambition or delusion?

Axon also laid down targets for 2028: $6 billion in annual revenue and 28% adjusted EBITDA margin.

For context: their current annualized revenue is around $3 billion. They're promising to double it in three years. That's aggressive as hell.

But if there's one thing I've learned watching companies that dominate regulated niches — public safety, defense, critical infrastructure — it's that once you become the default supplier, the *switching cost* is absurdly high. The cop who learns to use the Axon Assistant isn't going to want to switch. The department that integrated its data into the Axon ecosystem is locked in.

## What this means for you

Axon isn't some garage startup selling dreams. It's a profitable company reinvesting heavily at a moment of real technological transformation. The risk exists — it always does. If execution stumbles, if AI becomes a commodity, if regulation tightens, the castle could shake.

But tell me: how many companies do you know that beat estimates by 34%, grow revenue 39%, and still manage to sell more software than hardware to police departments?

While Instagram gurus are selling you day trading courses, Axon is proving AI isn't a pretty slide deck — it's real revenue.

The question that lingers: are you paying attention to the companies that *use* AI to make money, or are you still hypnotized by the ones that just *talk* about it?
