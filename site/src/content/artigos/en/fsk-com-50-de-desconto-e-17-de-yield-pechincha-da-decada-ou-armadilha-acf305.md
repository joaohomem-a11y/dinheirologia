There's a scene in the movie *The Platform* where the prisoners on the lower floors stare at the leftover food and have to decide: eat what's left or suspect there's something wrong with the feast? That's pretty much how I'm looking at FS KKR Capital Corp (FSK) right now.

A BDC (Business Development Company) trading at nearly a **50% discount to net asset value** and paying a **17% dividend yield**. On paper, it looks like the kind of thing that makes any dividend hunter drool all over their keyboard.

But the market isn't stupid. And when it prices a company at half of what it claims to be worth, it's telling you something. The question is whether you're listening.

## What Happened

Analyst Samuel Smith over at Seeking Alpha had already warned back in July of last year that FSK's risk-reward wasn't attractive and that the dividend was at risk. He sold his position and walked away.

Now, with the latest numbers and an earnings call that — in his words — "shocked the market," the thesis has taken on new chapters.

FSK's management, which carries the weight of the KKR name behind it (yes, the same KKR that's one of the biggest private equity firms on the planet), had a **golden opportunity** to calm investors down. The market was jittery, the discount to NAV was screaming, and all they needed was a clear signal of aggressive share buybacks or portfolio stabilization.

And what did they do? They gave a response that apparently made the market even more suspicious.

## Why the Discount Exists

Let's translate the finance jargon into plain English:

A BDC lends money to mid-sized companies — usually at high interest rates, because these are riskier loans. When the economy's humming, it's a dividend printing machine. When things tighten up, defaults start piling in and the NAV (asset value minus debt) starts melting away.

A 50% discount to NAV means the market thinks **half of what FSK claims to own isn't worth what's on the balance sheet**. Damn, that's brutal.

Compare that to Ares Capital (ARCC), which trades near NAV or even at a premium. Or Blue Owl (OBDC), which has a much more modest discount. FSK is the ugly duckling of the sector, and this isn't anything new.

## The Elephant in the Room

There are a few chronic problems here:

**1. A track record of destroying value.** FSK has a long history of cutting dividends and watching NAV shrink. Anyone who bought in thinking that 17% yield was guaranteed and forever has already gotten burned before.

**2. Portfolio quality.** A significant chunk of the loans are in cyclical sectors that are sensitive to high interest rates. With the Fed funds rate still elevated and no clear outlook for aggressive cuts, default risk goes up.

**3. Questionable skin in the game.** KKR's management collects its management fees like clockwork, regardless of the stock price. Nassim Taleb would ask: where's the skin in the game? If the manager wins no matter what, the alignment with shareholders is, at best, questionable.

**4. The earnings call response.** When management has the chance to get aggressive with buybacks at 50 cents on the dollar of NAV and doesn't do it with conviction, the signal is clear: either they don't trust their own numbers, or they have priorities that aren't yours.

## Bargain or Trap?

Warren Buffett has a quote I love: *"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."* FSK's price is cheap. But the value you're getting is the big unknown.

There are scenarios where this works out insanely well — if the American economy stays resilient, if defaults remain under control, if management finally decides to buy back shares aggressively. In that case, buying at a 50% discount would be like finding a hundred-dollar bill on the sidewalk.

But there's also the *Breaking Bad* scenario: things slowly deteriorate, dividend cut after dividend cut, NAV melting away, and you realize that the 17% yield was actually the perfect bait to trap you in a free-falling asset.

## The Practical Verdict

I have no position in FSK and don't plan to open one. Not because the company is necessarily going under — far from it, it's got the KKR name behind it. But because there are better BDCs out there, with more aligned management teams, higher-quality portfolios, and track records that don't look like a graveyard of slashed dividends.

If you're already in and sitting on losses, the decision is tougher. Selling at the bottom is painful. But holding just because "it'll come back someday" is the mindset that destroys more wealth in the market than anything else.

Now tell me: would you buy an asset that its own manager isn't in any rush to repurchase at half price?
