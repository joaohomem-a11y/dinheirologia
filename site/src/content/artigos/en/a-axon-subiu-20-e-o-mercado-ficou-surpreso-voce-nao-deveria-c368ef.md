There's a type of company that mainstream financial markets never quite know what to do with.

It's not a bank. It's not a big tech. It's not an automaker. It's the company that lives in no-man's-land — and that's exactly why, when it actually delivers real results, everyone suddenly wakes up and frantically hammers the buy button.

**Axon Enterprise** is exactly that kind of company.

You probably know it from its most famous product: the taser. That electric gun cops use to take down suspects without drawing a firearm. Simple as that. But calling Axon a "taser manufacturer" in 2026 is like calling Amazon a "bookstore."

## The Number That Matters

In the fourth quarter, the company reported **$797 million in revenue** — against an estimate of $755 million. Adjusted earnings of $2.15 per share, when consensus expected $1.60.

In other words: beat on the top, beat on the bottom, beat on both sides.

The stock surged more than **20% in a single day**.

And the 2026 guidance? Revenue growth between 27% and 30%. The market expected 25.8%. Sounds like a small difference? Think again: we're talking about a company already growing 39% annually on a base of nearly $800 million per quarter. This isn't a startup with a fantasy spreadsheet. This is execution.

## The AI That Isn't Guru Talk

Here's where it gets interesting — and where I need to separate the signal from the noise.

When a tech company says "AI" in 2026, the natural reflex is to cross your arms and demand proof. Because after three years of PowerPoints plastered with "AI-powered," "AI-first," and "AI-native," the word has become practically an insult to investors' intelligence.

But Axon isn't selling narrative. It's selling **product**.

The company's AI already accounts for **10% of total bookings** — that's equivalent to $750 million in contract bookings last year. Among the actual features: automatic license plate recognition and a voice assistant built into the body camera, called **Axon Assistant**, which already has over 500 active customers.

Know what that means? A cop in the field can talk to the camera on their chest and get real-time information. Sounds like a Black Mirror episode, but it's reality in 2026 — and people are already being billed for it.

CFO Brittany Bagley said something worth noting: she expects the **software segment to outpace hardware** in growth soon. Software already grew **40% in the quarter**, reaching $343 million.

That's the SaaS model walking through the front door of the public safety sector.

## CEO Rick Smith and "Skin in the Game"

Nassim Taleb taught us you should only listen to people who have something to lose. CEO Rick Smith founded the company in **1993**. Thirty-three years later, he's still there, still running the show, and told analysts on a call that AI represents a "different moment from anything he's experienced" in the company's history.

Look — that kind of statement from a founder-operator carries a different weight than when it comes from a CEO recruited on LinkedIn six months ago.

He's not managing a quarter. He's managing a legacy.

And when he says he's going to "deploy AI more aggressively and more responsibly than any other company in this space," you can take that more seriously than the generic conference-circuit speeches you sit through every year.

## What the Mainstream Market Was Doing in the Meantime

While Axon was quietly building a software business on top of a hardware base already installed across hundreds of police forces and security agencies around the world, the market was busy arguing about whether Nvidia would drop another 5% or whether the Fed would cut rates.

Same circus, different day.

Axon has something very few companies have: **captive customers locked in by contract, with sky-high switching costs, in a market where the main competitor is government bureaucracy itself**. Swapping out a state police force's body camera vendor is no easy task. The data, the systems, the maintenance contracts — everything ties them in.

And on top of all that, the company threw out a target of **$6 billion in annual revenue by 2028**, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28%.

That's not a startup promise. That's a target from a company that already knows how to scale.

---

The question left on the table is simple and uncomfortable:

How many companies in your portfolio have customers who literally **cannot switch vendors without a two-year public procurement process**, a software segment growing 40% per quarter, and a founder with three decades of skin in the game?

If the answer is zero, maybe the problem isn't the market.
