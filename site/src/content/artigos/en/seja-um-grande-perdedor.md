It's not easy to be a great loser.

From childhood, we're conditioned to focus on victories. In trading or in markets in general, we arrive with that same mindset. But here, it doesn't quite work that way.

The secret to beating the average — meaning, to beat the fateful statistic — is to program yourself to lose and get really good at it.

It all comes down to risk, return, and probability.

Learn to lose! Accept that the secret to your performance lies right there!

Stop believing in the Instagram and YouTube spectacle!

Stop believing in that pack of self-proclaimed elites from the circus! You give too much credit to people who don't put their own skin in the game!

My life is not the life of a demigod. There's blood and sweat on the floor of my office every single day!

I feel pain from my mistakes, I get furious when the market behaves like a bastard, and I love it when people close to me nail the same trade I did!

At the end of the day, I see myself more as a scientist testing his methods on his own body than anything even remotely resembling a master.

**CUT YOUR LOSSES!**
