You know that suit-wearing analyst who shows up on TV with the face of someone who has cracked the universe, throws out a price target with two decimal places, and speaks with the confidence of a biblical prophet?

CAVA just slapped him across the face.

Wall Street expected a 1.1% drop in comparable-store sales (*same-store sales*, for those still not fluent in financial jargon). The actual result? A 0.5% increase. Sounds small? In the restaurant business, with inflation eating into consumers' wallets, brutal competition, and the average American getting pickier with every dollar they spend, that's the difference between surviving and thriving.

The stock jumped over 20% in a single day.

Twenty. Percent. In one day.

**The Consensus Is Almost Always a Terrible Guide**

There's something Nassim Taleb repeats until he's blue in the face that 90% of retail investors completely ignore: market consensus isn't collective wisdom — it's collective mediocrity. It's a crowd of analysts copying each other, tweaking each other's models, and all landing on the same wrong number, together.

When everyone expects a drop and it drops less — or doesn't drop at all — the market's reaction is violent. Not because the result was extraordinary in absolute terms. But because the positioning was all wrong.

CAVA didn't pull off a miracle. It just didn't screw up.

And in a market that had already priced in the worst, not screwing up is enough to send you flying.

**What CAVA Is Doing Right (Without the Pretty Marketing)**

Let's strip away the corporate press release packed with "value proposition" and "meaningful human connection" — that MBA-speak that gives me a rash — and look at what actually matters.

First: price discipline. The company raised prices by just 1.7% at the start of 2025. In a sector where competitors were pushing through 5%, 8%, 10% hikes and then complaining that customers vanished, CAVA kept its head down. The result? Customers didn't vanish.

Second: real expansion. 72 new locations in 2025. Total of 439 units. Projecting another 74 to 76 in 2026. This isn't a PowerPoint slide. It's brick, mortar, and actual operations running.

Third: revenue above $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. Over 20% year-over-year growth. That, my friend, isn't luck. It's execution.

CFO Tricia Tolivar said something interesting that the market probably glossed over in the headlines: the chain's best-performing locations are in *lower* median-income areas. In other words, CAVA isn't a restaurant for trust-fund kids eating hummus with a view of Central Park. It's actually affordable.

At a moment when the American economy is becoming increasingly K-shaped — where the wealthy keep pulling ahead while the middle class slowly erodes — having a product that speaks to both ends of the curve is a real competitive advantage. That's not a narrative. It's data.

**The Danger of Falling in Love After the Rally**

Here comes the part nobody wants to hear after a 20% up day.

CAVA's stock isn't cheap. It never has been. It trades at multiples that require everything to keep working very well for a very long time. Any stumble — a disappointing round of store openings, a cost squeeze that crushes margins, an American consumer who decides to actually cut back — and the market will be equally ruthless on the way down.

Remember what Buffett says? "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." A great company bought at a steep price is still a bad deal.

Today's enthusiasm can be tomorrow's regret.

I'm not saying CAVA is going to fall. I'm saying that buying anything after a 20% single-day jump, driven by headline euphoria, is exactly the kind of behavior that makes the investor on the other side of the trade rich — the one who bought early, waited for the results, and is now happily selling to you.

Think about that before you fire off a market order at 10 a.m., fired up by a number you caught on a phone notification.

Whoever is selling you that stock right now knows something you don't — or is betting that you won't stop to think.

The question isn't whether CAVA is a good company.

The question is: **at what price is it good for you?**
