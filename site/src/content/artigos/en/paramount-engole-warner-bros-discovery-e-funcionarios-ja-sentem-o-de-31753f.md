"Synergies." If there's one word in the corporate dictionary that should come with a hazard warning, it's that one. Every time a CEO talks about "eliminating redundant operations," go ahead and translate: people are getting shown the door.

And that's exactly what's happening at Warner Bros. Discovery right now.

## The deal nobody asked for (except the shareholders)

On Thursday, WBD's board chose the Paramount Skydance acquisition offer — $31 per share — over Netflix's $27.75 bid. Mathematically, it makes sense for anyone holding stock. Three bucks and twenty-five cents more per share is nothing to sneeze at.

But here's the detail the market loves to ignore: **the share price doesn't pay the rent for the people who are about to lose their jobs.**

CNBC spoke anonymously with 10 WBD employees across different roles. All of them — **all ten** — expressed some level of fear about layoffs. And it's not paranoia. Paramount has already put a target of **$6 billion in cost cuts** on the table by eliminating "redundant operations in back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure, et cetera."

Et cetera. Lovely. When "et cetera" shows up on the cuts list, it's because the list is so long it won't even fit on the PowerPoint slide.

## Netflix was the dream. Paramount is the pragmatic nightmare.

Several WBD employees told CNBC they would have preferred being bought by Netflix. And the logic is crystal clear.

Netflix and WBD have **very little operational overlap**. Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO, repeated like a mantra that he'd leave WBD's business untouched — keeping theatrical film separate, HBO Max as an independent streaming service, and wouldn't even buy the linear cable TV channels. Translation: CNN, Turner Sports, Discovery channels — everyone keeps their job and continues as an independent public company.

Paramount? It's practically a mirror image of WBD. Both do news, sports, movies, streaming. When two companies do the same thing and merge, what happens? Someone tell me this isn't obvious.

It's like merging two restaurants that serve the same menu. You don't need two chefs, two cashiers, and two waiters. Somebody's getting let go.

## The ghost of CNN and Bari Weiss's fingerprints

If the generic headcount reductions are scary enough, the scenario at CNN is Stanley Kubrick-level psychological horror.

The Wall Street Journal reported in December that David Ellison, Paramount's CEO, **promised President Donald Trump** he would make drastic changes at CNN if he gained control of the network. Bari Weiss, currently editor-in-chief at CBS, could take over CNN under her umbrella.

Three CNN employees told CNBC there is **widespread fear** about radical changes to the anchors and the network's editorial tone.

Mark Thompson, who currently runs CNN, tried to calm the nerves: "Don't jump to conclusions about the future until we know more." The classic line from someone who also has no idea what's going to happen.

Brian Stelter, CNN's own media reporter, pointed out that the network is **highly profitable** and that it would be "foolish for any owner to put that at risk." Agreed. But since when has foolishness ever stopped an executive from doing something stupid?

## The deal might not even close — and then it's a whole other soap opera

David Zaslav, WBD's CEO, acknowledged in an all-hands meeting on Friday that the deal could be blocked by regulators in the U.S. and Europe. California Attorney General Rob Bonta already warned: "this is not a done deal."

Zaslav dropped a revealing line in audio leaked to Business Insider: **"If the deal doesn't close, we get $7 billion and go back to work."**

Seven billion in a breakup fee. Damn. That's nearly one Marvel movie a month for a decade. It's the kind of "Plan B" that only exists in the world of billion-dollar mergers.

## Too many cooks in the kitchen

On the entertainment side, the fear is different: **too many chiefs**. Jeff Shell (Paramount president, former NBCUniversal CEO), Cindy Holland (streaming director), George Cheeks (TV president, former Paramount co-CEO) — all used to being the ones calling the shots. Throw WBD's people into that pot and tell me who's going to stir it.

Creativity and innovation don't survive bureaucracies built on ego. Ask any screenwriter in Hollywood.

While Wall Street celebrates the $31-per-share premium, thousands of people inside WBD are secretly updating their LinkedIn profiles. The financial markets love to celebrate "shareholder value creation." But the ones who foot the bill for synergies are always the same: the people who don't have a seat in the boardroom.

The question that lingers: **when was the last time a media megamerger actually delivered on its promises — without leaving a trail of destruction in its wake?**
