I'll be honest with you: I got this "article" about Bask Bank to analyze and you know what showed up? **Nothing.** Literally nothing. A wall of text about cookies, privacy, and data consent. Zero financial information. Zero analysis. Zero substance.

And that, my friend, is the perfect metaphor for most of the financial content floating around out there in 2025.

## The Bank Review Circus

Pay attention to the pattern: big financial outlets publish "reviews" of digital banks that are, at their core, **glorified advertorials**. Seductive headlines like "Earn more interest on your savings with this online bank!" — as if there were free lunches in the financial markets.

It's the same logic as Neo being sold the blue pill in The Matrix. Comfortable. Pretty. And completely disconnected from reality.

Nassim Taleb warned us: **beware of those with no skin in the game**. The outlet publishing the review earns an affiliate commission. The digital bank lands a customer. And you? You get an article that didn't even load properly — just a cookie consent screen.

## What You Should Be Asking Before Trusting a Digital Bank

Since the original content left me high and dry, I'll do the job they didn't. Before you go wiring your money to any digital bank — whether it's Bask Bank or any other — ask these questions:

**1. What's the real protection on your money?**
In the U.S., there's FDIC insurance. It covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. If the digital bank doesn't have that coverage, damn, run. It sounds like a lot of money until the day it isn't.

**2. Where does the above-average yield come from?**
If a bank is offering you interest rates way above the market, ask yourself: why aren't the others offering the same thing? Remember every Ponzi scheme artist promising 5% a month? Benjamin Graham taught us back in the 1930s: **abnormal returns demand abnormal suspicion**.

**3. What's the actual business model?**
Every bank needs to make money somewhere. Hidden fees? FX spread? Selling your data? If you're not paying for the product, you're probably **the product**. That wall of cookies that was supposed to be the article is proof of that.

**4. Liquidity — can I withdraw when I need to?**
High yield with a 90-day lock-up is one thing. High yield with daily liquidity is a completely different animal. Understand the rules before you get in.

## The Inconvenient Truth About Digital Banks

Don't get me wrong. There are excellent digital banks out there. Financial disruption is real and welcome. Competition drives down fees, improves service, and frees consumers from the stranglehold of traditional banking oligopolies.

But most of the "reviews" you read out there are **sales catalogs disguised as journalism**. The person writing it doesn't have a single penny in that bank. They never tested customer service at 11 PM on a Sunday when a transfer didn't go through. They never lived through the gut-wrenching anxiety of a withdrawal frozen for "security review" for five business days.

Charlie Munger used to say: "Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome." The incentives behind bank reviews are completely misaligned with your interests.

## So What Should You Do?

Simple as a punch in the face:

- **Diversify across institutions.** Don't put everything in one bank, digital or otherwise.
- **Read the contract**, not the review. Boring? Yes. Necessary? Like oxygen.
- **Be suspicious of anyone who speaks too highly** of any financial product without showing the risks.
- **Do your own due diligence.** If a blogger can convince you to deposit $50,000 somewhere with a 500-word article, you've got a bigger problem than your choice of bank.

When the content that's supposed to inform you shows up empty — just cookies and trackers — the message is loud and clear: **your data is worth more to them than your financial education**.

So, are you going to keep swallowing pre-chewed reviews or are you going to start asking the right questions?
