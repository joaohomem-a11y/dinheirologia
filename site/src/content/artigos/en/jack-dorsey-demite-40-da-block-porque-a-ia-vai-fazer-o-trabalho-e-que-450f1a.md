There's a scene in *Up in the Air* where George Clooney flies around the country firing people. He does it with a professional smile, a handshake, and a neat little severance package. It's cold, it's efficient, it's corporate.

Now imagine Clooney replaced by an algorithm.

That's pretty much what Jack Dorsey — yes, the guy who created Twitter and founded Block (formerly Square) — just did. He cut **40% of Block's workforce**. Not 4%. Not 14%. Forty percent. Nearly half the company. And the reason? Artificial intelligence.

## The Unfiltered Message

Dorsey didn't come with that corporate BS about "strategic restructuring to optimize synergies." Nope. The guy was blunt: AI can already do what a lot of people inside the company do. And he doesn't think this is unique to Block. In his view, most companies will make similar cuts over the next 12 months.

Damn. Read that again.

The founder of a publicly traded fintech company, who knows Silicon Valley from the inside out, is saying out loud what CEOs whisper at private dinners: **AI isn't going to replace jobs "someday." It's already replacing them. Right now.**

## What This Actually Means

Let's step away from the headline theater and into reality.

Block isn't some garage startup. It's a publicly traded company with payment operations, lending, Cash App, and even Bitcoin mining. When a company of that scale cuts 40% of its headcount, it's not an impulse decision. It's a cold calculation: it cost X to keep those people, AI delivers Y for the same result, and Y < X. Period.

This is Nassim Taleb in its purest form. *Skin in the game*. Dorsey isn't on a TED Talk stage philosophizing about the future of work. He **is firing people**. It's the difference between the guy who reads about swimming and the guy who jumps into freezing water.

And here's the most disturbing part of his statement: **he believes most companies will follow this path within the next year.**

If he's right — and let's be honest, the guy has a decent track record of seeing the curve before everyone else — we're staring down a wave of mass layoffs disguised as "digital transformation."

## The Elephant in the Room

You know what nobody in mainstream finance wants to openly discuss? That this wave of generative AI, of cognitive task automation, isn't like the Industrial Revolution. Back then, machines replaced arms. Now, algorithms are replacing **brains**. Analysts, junior programmers, copywriters, designers, customer service reps, project managers.

The middle class that lives off repetitive intellectual work is in the same position as factory workers in 1890. Except nobody gave them the heads-up.

And the market? The market **loves it**. Cost cuts, wider margins, operational efficiency. Block's stock will probably react well to this. Wall Street always applauds when the guillotine drops on the payroll.

## The Question That Lingers

Warren Buffett always said you only find out who's swimming naked when the tide goes out. The AI tide is rising, not receding — but the effect is the same. It's exposing who is **truly** essential and who was just filler.

Jack Dorsey made the first major public and explicit bet: he cut nearly half his company, wagering that the machine does it better and cheaper.

The question isn't whether he's right or wrong. The question is: **if the CEO of your company — or you yourself, as an entrepreneur — had to run the same numbers tomorrow, how much of your team would survive?**

More importantly: **would you survive?**

Because the next Jack Dorsey might be your boss. And the next layoff memo might have your name on it.

Sleep on that.
