You know that scene in The Joker where he says "nobody panics when things go according to plan"? Yeah. The opposite holds true too: when something looks too good, everyone starts clapping without asking why.

Mortgage rates in the United States dropped below 6% for the first time in years. NPR reported it. The market celebrated. PR reps at homebuilders are probably already drafting optimistic press releases with phrases like "new era" and "historic opportunity."

Me? I'm sitting here with my chin in my hand. Like that thinking guy meme. Because the question nobody's asking is the most important one: **why the hell are rates falling?**

## What's behind the curtain

Falling mortgage rates don't come out of thin air. They don't drop because the universe is feeling generous or because some bureaucrat in Washington decided to throw the middle class a bone.

US mortgage rates primarily track the 10-year Treasury yield. When yields fall, it's usually because the market is pricing in one of two things: **rate cuts by the Fed** or **fear of recession**. Sometimes both at the same time.

And that's where the problem lives.

When some guy sees the headline "mortgage rates drop below 6%!" he thinks: "Sweet, time to buy my house!" What he should be thinking is: "Wait — what is the bond market telling me about the economy?"

It's the same logic as when you see a 70% discount on an expensive product. Either it's been sitting on the shelf forever, or there's something wrong with it. A steep discount with no clear reason is a red flag, not a reason to party.

## The context the headline is hiding

Let's rewind the tape: mortgage rates hit nearly 8% in October 2023. It was a bloodbath. The American housing market practically froze solid. Anyone locked into a 3% mortgage from the pandemic era wouldn't sell if you put a gun to their head — because swapping it for a 7.5% rate would be financial suicide. The infamous "lock-in effect."

Now, with rates dropping back below 6%, the narrative is that the market will thaw out. More sales, more activity, more construction.

Maybe. But think about this with me: US home prices **didn't drop significantly** during that high-rate period. Supply stayed tight precisely because of the lock-in effect. So what we have now is a scenario with lower rates, sure, but with prices still stretched to hell and back.

Translation: the guy now pays less in interest, but the home price is still sky-high. The relief is partial, at best.

## What this means for investors

For the Brazilian investor following the American market — whether through REITs, homebuilder stocks like D.R. Horton or Lennar, or simply trying to figure out where the global economy is headed — this drop in rates is a mixed signal.

If rates are falling because the Fed is going to cut in a soft-landing scenario, great. Risk-on, party, confetti. But if they're falling because the economy is decelerating faster than expected, that's a whole different beast.

As old man Buffett would say: "Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."

And the tide, my friend, might be going out.

## The lesson Brazil can take from this

Here in Brazil, we know this dance all too well. Rates go up, the housing market dies. Rates come down, everyone wants to buy a pre-construction apartment with monthly payments that "fit the budget." The cycle repeats. And people keep buying during the euphoria and getting wrecked during the hangover.

The principle is universal: **don't buy the headline, buy the context.**

Nassim Taleb wrote that people's problem is confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence. The fact that rates are falling doesn't mean the coast is clear. It means something changed — and you need to understand **what** changed before making any decisions.

So before you start celebrating that "the American housing market is back," answer me this: if everything is so great, why is the bond market pricing in a darker scenario?
