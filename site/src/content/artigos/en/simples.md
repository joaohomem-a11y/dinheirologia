*Simplicity is complexity resolved. - Constantin Brancusi*

I find it a bit odd when I see all the legend that's been built around me: Discretionary, Feeling, Freestyle, Gift, Talent... and a whole lot more labels, causes, and bits of magic.

None of that exists.

I've been interested in economics and business management for as long as I can remember. The 90s had barely begun and I was already a regular at the libraries in Belo Horizonte. My father had a shop and subscribed to the Estado de Minas newspaper to keep his customers happy. But the business section was always missing, because I'd take it to read and check the prices of "my companies" — the ones I pretended I'd bought.

What I do today looks fairly simple. The word that might best describe what I do today would be...

## **SMOOTH**

To build a truly good system, you need to understand every detail involved in that construction.

*"You have to internalize the essence of it. It takes a passionate involvement to understand something in its totality, to really chew it thoroughly, not just swallow it quickly." - Steve Jobs*

There's no magic! What exists are eyes tired from reading, a face burned by screens, and a hunger for growth.

*"When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don't really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it's really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That's sort of the middle, and that's where most people stop. But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works." - Steve Jobs*

No trader, holder, analyst, or YouTube demigod has ever described the journey of a market guy as perfectly as Jobs did in just one paragraph!

Don't stop! Keep pushing!

*João Homem*
